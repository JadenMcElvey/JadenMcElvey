### Google STEP Intern | Summer 2021
This past summer I interned on the Geo Assistant Driving team at Google. My internship was structured around a project that I completed over 12 weeks. My project was to add electric vehicle related voice actions to Google Assistant. As a part of this project I conttributed code to both Google Assistant and the Google Maps Mobile App. While I primarily wrote code in C++ and Java I also learned a lot about other aspects of software engineering. I had the opputunity to write design documents, participate in design reviews, participare in code reviews, and learn more about how to write software tests.
